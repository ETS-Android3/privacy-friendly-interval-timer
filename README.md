This app belongs to the group of Privacy Friendly Apps developed by the Technische Universität Darmstadt.

## Motivation

The motivation of this project is to provide users with an application which supports their training sessions without advertisement or the demand of unnecessary permissions. Privacy Friendly Apps are a group of Android applications which are optimized regarding privacy. Further information can be found on secuso.org/pfa
